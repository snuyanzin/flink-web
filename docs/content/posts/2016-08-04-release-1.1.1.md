Today, the Flink community released Flink version 1.1.1.

The Maven artifacts published on Maven central for 1.1.0 had a Hadoop dependency issue: No Hadoop 1 specific version (with version 1.1.0-hadoop1) was deployed and 1.1.0 artifacts have a dependency on Hadoop 1 instead of Hadoop 2.

This was fixed with this release and we **highly recommend** all users to use this version of Flink by bumping your Flink dependencies to version 1.1.1:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-streaming-java_2.10</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-clients_2.10</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

You can find the binaries on the updated [Downloads page](http://flink.apache.org/downloads.html).
