Information about your use of this website is collected using server access logs.
We do this to understand what parts of the website are important to our users,
what features are most frequently read up on, where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website, and the docs
and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

1. The IP address from which you access the website;
2. The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site;
3. The date and time you access our site;
4. The pages you visit;
5. If you click on any of the file download links on our website;
6. The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site;

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software [Matomo](https://matomo.org/).
